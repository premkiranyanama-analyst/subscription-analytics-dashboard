## Project Goal
Analyze subscription data to understand customer retention, churn, revenue trends, and cohort behavior.

## Tools Used
- SQL (data cleaning and transformation)
- Power BI (dashboarding, DAX, cohort & tenure analysis)

## Key Metrics
- Total Subscribers: 3,069  
- Active Subscribers: 1,065  
- Retention Rate: 34.7%  

## What I Built
- KPI Overview (subscriber health)
- Monthly Revenue Trend (paid subscriptions)
- Active vs Cancelled retention breakdown
- Cohort retention analysis (by signup month)
- Average subscriber tenure by cohort (months stayed)

## Business Insights
- Retention is low (~34.7%), indicating high churn.
- Revenue shows steady growth despite churn, suggesting new paid subscribers offset cancellations.
