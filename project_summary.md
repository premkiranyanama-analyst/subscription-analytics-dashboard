## How I approached this project
1. Cleaned raw subscription data (dates, missing values, paid indicator)
2. Defined core KPIs: total, active, retention %, revenue
3. Built retention breakdown (Active vs Cancelled)
4. Created cohort month and tenure (months active) logic
5. Visualized cohort retention and average tenure trends
6. Summarized business insights and improvement opportunities
